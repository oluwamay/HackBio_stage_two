# Identification of Somatic and Germline variant from Tumor and Normal sample pairs
## Reproduced by Oluwayowa Samuel
###### INTRODUCTION
Mutation in molecular biology is the alteration in the nucleic acid sequence of a genome
creating an abnormal protein or preventing the formation of one. It is responsible for 
normal and abnormal (most times harmful) biological processes such as; Evolution, Cancer
and development of the immune system. Mutation of tumor suppressor gene is implicated in 
most cases of cancer in humans. The Tumor Suppressor genes are responsible for the 
monitoring of the rate of cell division, repairing of mismatched DNA and the control of 
when a cell dies. So when a Tumor Suppressor gene mutates it leads to uncontrollable cell 
division. These mutations can be Somatic (acquired during a lifetime) or Germline (inherited 
from parents). Germline variants are identified by comparing a sample genome to a reference 
while Somatic variants are identified using normal and tumor tissue.
> In this project, the aim was to reproduce a workflow that identifies Germline and Somatic 
variants affected by loss of Heterozygosity using both a healthy and tumour tissue, from which 
we will report variant sites and genes affected that could likely be the cause of the disease.
Such insights can help us track tumorigenesis in patients and help in the diagnosis, prognosis,
developing and guiding therapeutic strategies.
